#test2 为代码进行注释
# a comment , this is so you can  read your  program later 
#anything after the $ is ignored by python.
print "I could have code like this "#and the comment after is ignored 
#you can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
#print "this won't run"
print  "thies will run"

#test3 数字和数学计算
print "i will now count my chichkens"
print "hens", 25+30/6   #逗号在这里不会被识别

print "now I will count the eggs"

print "is it true that 3+2<5-7?"
print 3+2<5-7
print "what is 3+2?", 3+2
print "what is 5-7?%" ,5-7
print "oh ,m that's why it's false"
